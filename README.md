# Zeno the Dynamic Coherence Controller

This app visualizes semantic queries as dynamic energy fields using an adaptive DGFT controller. You can toggle semantic metrics like Zeno Î¼ (coherence), token entropy, and embedding variance to understand their impact on topology.
## ðŸ§ª Prototype UI

This is a mock-up of the Streamlit interface for the Adaptive DGFT Zeno Controller with metric toggles and live surface visualization:

## Features

- OpenAI-based embeddings
- 3D field generation with Î¼, entropy, and variance
- Metric toggles for interactive analysis
- Query scoreboard with metric logs
