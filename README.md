# Q-Zeno Topology Explorer

This app visualizes semantic queries as dynamic energy fields using an adaptive DGFT controller. You can toggle semantic metrics like Zeno μ (coherence), token entropy, and embedding variance to understand their impact on topology.

## Features

- OpenAI-based embeddings
- 3D field generation with μ, entropy, and variance
- Metric toggles for interactive analysis
- Query scoreboard with metric logs
